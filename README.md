This project is a JavaScript-based console quiz game developed for Web Dev Lab Assignment 4. It stores questions in an array, displays them using a loop, collects answers through prompt(), and gives feedback with alert(). The code is organized with functions for better structure. User input is cleaned using toLowerCase() and trim(), and the score is calculated and shown at the end. The quiz can be run by opening index.html in a browser and viewing the console.
